# QuantumComputing
A simple project of entanglement between three qubits.
But the noticable thing is that I've two plots saved as .png files
First one is generated normally by the simulator in a classical Computer, you can
recognise it its plotted for only two logics 000 and 011
But the second one is the plot generated by an original Quantum Computer
which generates more error so that we have 000,001,010,011,100,101,111
You might be thinking how did I got Access to quantum computer
well its easy
IBM-Quantum-Computing helps us to get access to their Quantum computer
Creating an Account in IBMQ and then for developers, they develop an Application
Porgramming Interface(API) Code which helps us to Get access to their Quantum Computer

We need to send our code as a response to IBM and they will return us the out with in 40-100
Seconds
the time duration is based on the que how many developers are accessing

I will seperately put a Code to how to access IBMQ's Quantum Computer within our code

note that the the probabilites vary from computation to computation
