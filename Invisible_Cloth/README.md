# Invisible-Cloth
Hey Guys!
The main Idea of the project is to write a code which detects a particular color(Here it's Blue) and replaces the color with other Image(Here its Background)

At the beginning,the camera Captures the background(2-3seconds) and after finishing of capturing,recording window opens.
After it's opening,the person should sit infront of the background without moving the position of camera so that
it doesn't alter background(It works even if you change the background after background capturing by changing the direction of camera,but it replaces the color 
with the captured background)

Output:
If you put a blue colored cloth on your body,the cloth and the parts which are covered by the cloth are replaced by the background which 
appears like "Magical Cloth" that hide humans as of in fantasy films like HarryPotter,Lord of the Rings etc
Happy Coding :)
