# Invisible-Cloth
Hey Guys!This is a mini project in Computer Vision
Problem Statement:

Take a Cloth/Shirt/any other thing of a particular color and wear it on your body so that
the camera detects that particular color and makes the parts that are covered under the cloth.Simply you need to replace
the Colored cloth with the background.

Method of Approach:

At the beginning,the camera Captures the background(2-3seconds).This Background is captured because we need to
replace the color with this background.
After finishing of capturing,recording window opens.
After it's opening,the person should sit infront of the background without moving the position of camera so that
it doesn't alter background(It works even if you change the background after background capturing by changing the direction of camera,but it replaces the color 
with the captured background)

Output:
If you put a blue colored cloth on your body,the cloth and the parts which are covered by the cloth are replaced by the background which 
appears like "Magical Cloth" that hide humans as of in fantasy films like HarryPotter,Lord of the Rings etc

Happy Coding :)
